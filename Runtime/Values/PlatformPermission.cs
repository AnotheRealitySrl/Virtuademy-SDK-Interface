    /// case-sensitively — so renaming a member here breaks it silently: the name stops matching, the
    /// permission stops being granted, and it reads as a permissions bug rather than as a rename.

    /// explicitly and are not contiguous — 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13 do not exist, having been
    /// retired server-side. Nothing matches on them today; they are here so a value seen in a
    /// database row or an API payload can be correlated with a member. Do not renumber them either,
    /// for that reason.
